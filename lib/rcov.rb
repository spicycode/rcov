# rcov, you'll notice that only code inside methods is reported as covered,
# very much like what happens when you run it with --test-unit-only.
# This is due to the fact that we're running rcov on itself: the code below is
# already loaded before coverage tracing is activated, so only code inside
# methods is actually executed under rcov's inspection.
